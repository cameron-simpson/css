Overview documentation for some of these scripts may be found here:

Some of the Python modules are availoable from PyPI here:

  https://pypi.python.org/pypi?%3Aaction=search&term=cameron+simpson&submit=search

(Because PyPI lacks "author" pages, that is a crude search for my name, which happens to get only my packages at present; they all have names starting "cs." should you need to disambiguate things.)

An autoindex of the scripts is in the file 1INDEX.txt.

Installing my scripts:

  Unpack the tarball:

    http://www.cskk.ezoshosting.com/cs/css/css.tar.gz

  into a suitable directory eg "/opt/css", which I will assume for
  the sake of example below.

  Configure your environment to use the scripts:

    . /opt/css/env.sh

  That line should be in your .profile or other environment setup
  script.  It's pretty simple; it adds the css components to the
  END of your PATHs (so no css script name preempts anything you
  already have).

  It mostly does this:

    PATH=$PATH:/opt/css/bin

    MANPATH=$MANPATH:/opt/css/man

    PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:/opt/css/lib/python

    CLASSPATH=$CLASSPATH:/opt/css/lib/java/au.com.zip.cs.jar

    PERL5LIB=$PERL5LIB:/opt/css/lib/perl

    export PATH MANPATH PYTHONPATH CLASSPATH PERL5LIB

  Several of the scripts expect the following shell environment variables:

    $HOST       Your machine's short name.
                        Defaults to $HOSTNAME without the trailing components.

    $HOSTNAME   Your machine's fully qualified domain name.
                        Defaults to `hostname`.

    $ARCH       Your architecure, in the form vendor.cpu.os,
            eg sun.sparc.solaris or sgi.mips.irix.

    $SYSTEMID   A name for your machines' administrative domain
            (eg: I use "home" for my home LAN
            and "zip" for my ISP: zip.com.au).

    $USER       Your login name.

    $SITENAME   Your email domain (eg zip.com.au for me).

    $EMAIL      Your email address (just "who@where", no "<>"s); normally $USER@$SITENAME.

  There are some others, but those cover the common stuff.

Licence:

    You're free to use, modify and redistribute these scripts provided that:

    - you leave my code marked as mine and your modifications (if any)
      marked as yours; it's enough to prefix your code with a terse
      comment like:

              # change text - reason text - yourname <youremail> - date

    - you make recipients aware that the scripts can be obtained for
      free from my own web page

Warrantee:

    None whatsoever!

    These scripts work for me, but any of them may have bugs or be
    arbitrarily dependent on my own login environment.  While I try to
    make most of them usable by others (and am happy to hear suggestions
    or bug reports), they're for my use and may well not meet your needs.
    But feel free to hack them to meet your needs.
