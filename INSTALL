Installing my scripts:

    Unpack into a suitable directory (eg "~/scripts-cs", which I will assume
	for the sake of example below).
    Add the full pathname for that directory to the END of your $PATH.
	Also add the full path for the directory ~/scripts-cs/synonyms.
    The Perl modules are in the directory ~/scripts-cs/cs, so add
	~/scripts-cs to your $PERL5LIB varaible, or make a symlink named "cs"
	from your generic perl library directory to that subdir. The aim here
	is that "use cs::blah" will find the module ~/scripts-cs/cs/blah.pm.

    Several of the scripts expect the following shell environment variables:

	$HOST		Your machine's short name.
	$HOSTNAME	Your machine's fully qualified domain name.
	$ARCH		Your architecure, in the form vendor.cpu.os,
			eg sun.sparc.solaris or sgi.mips.irix.
	$SYSTEMID	A name for your machines administrative domain
			(eg: I use "cisra" for my workplace: CISRA,
			"home" for home and "zip" for my ISP: zip.com.au).
	$USER		Your login name.
	$SITENAME	Your email domain (eg zip.com.au for me).
	$EMAIL		Your email address (just "who@where", no "<>"s);
			normally $USER@$SITENAME.

    There are some others, but those cover the common stuff.

Licence:

    You're free to use, modify and redistribute these scripts provided that:

	- you leave my code marked as mine and your modifications (if any)
	  marked as yours

	- you make recipients aware that the scripts can be obtained for
	  free from my own web page

Warrantee:

    None. These scripts work for me, but any of them may have
    bugs or be arbitrarily dependent on my own login environment.
    While I try to make most of them usable by others (and am happy
    to hear suggestions or bug reports), they're for my use and may
    well not meet your needs.
    But feel free to hack them to meet your needs.
