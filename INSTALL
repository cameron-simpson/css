Overview documentation for some of these scripts may be found here:

and manual entries in HTML format here:

Installing my scripts:

    Unpack the tarball:
	    http://www.cskk.ezoshosting.com/css/css.tar.gz
    into a suitable directory (eg "/opt/css", which I will assume for the
    sake of example below).

    Add the full pathname for the bin directory to the END of your $PATH.
	Eg:
		PATH=$PATH:/opt/css/bin
		export PATH

    Add the full pathname of the lib directory to the END of your $PERL5LIB:

		PERL5LIB=$PERL5LIB:/opt/css/lib
		export PERL5LIB

    The aim here is that "use cs::blah" will find the module
    /opt/css/lib/cs/blah.pm. Alternatively you could just symlink
    from your site_perl dir:

		cd /usr/lib/perl5/site_perl
		ln -s /opt/css/lib/cs .

    You probably also want to add the manuals to your $MANPATH:

		MANPATH=$MANPATH:/opt/css/man
		export MANPATH

    Several of the scripts expect the following shell environment variables:

	$HOST		Your machine's short name.
	$HOSTNAME	Your machine's fully qualified domain name.
	$ARCH		Your architecure, in the form vendor.cpu.os,
			eg sun.sparc.solaris or sgi.mips.irix.
	$SYSTEMID	A name for your machines' administrative domain
			(eg: I use "home" for my home LAN
			and "zip" for my ISP: zip.com.au).
	$USER		Your login name.
	$SITENAME	Your email domain (eg zip.com.au for me).
	$EMAIL		Your email address (just "who@where", no "<>"s);
			normally $USER@$SITENAME.

    There are some others, but those cover the common stuff.

Licence:

    You're free to use, modify and redistribute these scripts provided that:

	- you leave my code marked as mine and your modifications (if any)
	  marked as yours

	- you make recipients aware that the scripts can be obtained for
	  free from my own web page

Warrantee:

    None whatsoever!

    These scripts work for me, but any of them may have bugs or be
    arbitrarily dependent on my own login environment.  While I try to
    make most of them usable by others (and am happy to hear suggestions
    or bug reports), they're for my use and may well not meet your needs.
    But feel free to hack them to meet your needs.
