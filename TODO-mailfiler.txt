mailfiler needed 2 ctrl-c to exit
support renaming headers in a cascade, example for googlegroups dkim, shuffle From to x-from-ggroups, shuffle x-original-from to from
make default header set tunable, eg include sender: in to/cc/bcc, would halve my ruleset
easy match on label, supporting classify early, file later
some kind of pass mode, probably DEFAULT=.
translate mailfiler.1.pod and .5.pod to md
+target adds the target but does not count as "filed" - for crossfiling
use a runstate for global control and SIGINT
make + rules not set the "filed" flag - for xref, labels etc
prepend received lines on pickup and filing
