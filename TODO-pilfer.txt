pilfer from: can we use the Pilfer cache.find_content over url.GET ?
URLFetcher - if there are cached keys and uncaches keys for a URL, link an old cache entry to the new keys

prefetch should skip+warning URLs with no cache keys
requestheaders should block on in-progress identifcal fetches based on the cache keys?
cache should cache against all sitemap keys
pipe-stage|pipeline runs the stage and pipes its results to pipeline, passing the original input through to the next stage
