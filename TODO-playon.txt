SEI.from_Recording: also parse leading sSSeEE - from the playon.Name field
if no series/season/episode, check the thumbnail path for "series | season N" p
playon refresh: accept q ids to ping the API, mainly to expire zombie entries
queue - what is the Status field? can I check for expired queue items
"playon help" still logs in etc
clean expired queued items somehow, same with pending
incorporate the season/episode stripping functions, gather them into the format and tags if missing
honour SIGINT during dl and during refresh, run_task during refresh
playon not autorefreshing
