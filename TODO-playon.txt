strip episode-n:- in title
refresh should expire old entries which do not appear in the API response
SEI.from_Recording: also parse leading sSSeEE - from the playon.Name field
queue - what is the Status field? can I check for expired queue items
"playon help" still logs in etc
clean expired queued items somehow, same with pending
incorporate the season/episode stripping functions, gather them into the format and tags if missing
honour SIGINT during dl and during refresh, run_task during refresh
playon not autorefreshing
