cs.distinfo: update URLs from bitbucket to sr.ht
cs.distinfo: release log: include href to full commit log for the primary file or dir
ds.distinfo: add cmd_diff to present diff from latest release
compute_doc: mode to document all methods for use in upcoming module-README-autodoc.md
cs-release checkout et al: accept -r revision arguments
MRO: "builtins.*" should get the "builtins." stripped eg builtins.dict
can we put anchors on class and function headings?
if second and following paragraphs exists, maybe give them an Overview header?
pull first paragraph to to above "latest release"
module check code: produce nested {imported_name=>[errors]}, each error is either a str or another {import=>errors} mapping; nice printout to go with it for cmd_check
upgrade the distinfo stuff with a mode to emit all the docstrings so that a module automatic README.md describes everything
cs-release,cs.distinfo: include not just names from the direct module but also names imported from the current package as in cs.p3
distinfo: append __init__ docstring to class docstring? summary of other methods? kinda verbose
make cs.distinfo just do a Package class, split out PyPI stuff into cs.app.pypi.PyPI(PKG, base urls...)
cs-release: generate and commit cs/module_README.md files (does markdown have a comment syntax?) so I can point to them as the module homepage
