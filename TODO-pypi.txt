module check code: produce nested {imported_name=>[errors]}, each error is either a str or another {import=>errors} mapping; nice printout to go with it for cmd_check
move lastvalues into repo maintained "pkg_tags" file
cs.distinfo: port to BaseCommand
upgrade the distinfo stuff with a mode to emit all the docstrings so that a module automatic README.md describes everything
cs-release,cs.distinfo: include not just names from the direct module but also names imported from the current package as in cs.p3
distinfo: append __init__ docstring to class docstring? summary of other methods? kinda verbose
make cs.distinfo just do a Package class, split out PyPI stuff into cs.app.pypi.PyPI(PKG, base urls...)
cs-release: generate and commit cs/module_README.md files (does markdown have a comment syntax?) so I can point to them as the module homepage
