cs.deco: contextual docstring looks very wrong, see PyPI page
mailfiler run_context stackattrs loginfo.level=INFO is actually ineffective, how to modify cs.logutils to fix this?
BaseCommand: accept dict for initial options, some way to honour this during apply_defaults
media,beyonwiz: use ffmpeg-python for ffmpeg control, obsolete cs.ffmpeg or turn into a shim
bin/nodedb: turn into pure python nodedb main programme, replace this script with secure python stub
resolve bin/maildb vs bin-cs/cs-maildb
upgrade the distinfo stuff with a mode to emit all the docstrings so that a modul automatic README.md describes everything
svcd: subprocess to chdir to $HOME or defined directory - via incd? - for reliable behaviour and logging
cs-release: generate and commit cs/module_README.md files (does markdown have a comment syntax?) so I can point to them as the module homepage
setup_logging: can this be a context manager pushing a handler (ideally hiding existing handlers)
cs-release,cs.distinfo: include not just names from the direct module but also names imported from the current package as in cs.p3
cs.py3: update cs.p3 module docstring with example code as it does not show the submodule names
cs.cmdutils: extract Usage: from cmd_ methods to augument main USAGE
cs.upd: multiline status area
logutils: use cs.tty stuff for the status() function
@strable: treat pathlike things like str?
@locked: do a timedout acquire with backoff to aid deadlock debugging
RunState flow diagram: pending->running->cancelled-stopped and triggers?
cs.app.flags: make a FlagOSDir mapping class to implement the fs based flags, accept any mapping for the Flags class, move the normalisation the the Flags class otherwise a raw mapping impl might fail if moved to the fs
Pfx: do not insert umark: if umark is empty, supports "" and None
implement cs.lex cutprefix and cutsuffix, push to PyPI after testing in PM stuff
make most cs.obj methods functions, try to drop O class
mutt-highlight: match markers at start or end of lines
readline: fix spelling, detab, apply set -ue, use read -r line as fallback
cs.excutils_tests: special logging setup to discard error messages - the successful test suite is very noisy
distinfo: append __init__ docstring to class docstring? summary of other methods? kinda verbose
@decorator: issue warning if positional arg 0 is callable and other args supplied, at least for the interim
@decorator: maybe support @deco(callable,*a,**kw)?
@mapattr class decorator to map .foo to .bah.this.that... with get/set support
cs.deco: @decorator: does not seem to propagate __doc__ to wrapper functions from inner function - needs debugging
man pages not included in PyPI packages, for example cs.app.mailfiler
cs.app.megacli: after fixup, copy to megacli_legacy as py2, upgrade megacli to python 3, update module docstrings to explain and reference
mcli: alarm control, locate control
cs.result: attach a RunState and use it for the .state property - support attach in __init__ to use an existing runstate
rc/shell/fn-vcs: move repeated-commit check into hg() and git() functions
@cached: cache generators
replace cs.env.envsub with os.path.expandvars
portfwd: changes to match svcd changes
svcd: take a Service instance, which will have optional on_reap, on_spawn etc method, cutting down the ludicrous param list
make cs.distinfo just do a Package class, split out PyPI stuff into cs.app.pypi.PyPI(PKG, base urls...)
drop lib/python/cs/testdata/cs.mailutils/maildir, too big
cs.mappings: support passing a named_column_tuple class to the names_columns_tuples loader
mappings: named tuple rows: omit columns with empty names - common in spreadsheet exports and breaks namedtuples
iso14496: parser for mdat section - how to know the audio/video format?
cs.flags: put a lock around all accesses
SvcD to subclass RunStateMixin?
Results to inherit from RunStateMixin?
SvcD/Portfwd: if there some inlocked dict access or something to trigger the segfault?
SvcD/Portfwd: cleanup mode polling pid files to kill former processes
take the wait-until-idle code from cs.vt.index.LMDBIndex and turn into a general facility in cs.resources
cs.resources: finish subopen proxy support
PyPI: remove cs.asynchron once dependent packages updated
cs.logutils.status: fold into cs.statusline, merge features
speed up cs.lex.unctrl using enumerate and join of substrs
make Asynchrons __await__able
port cs.fileutils.files_property to cs.deco.cached
cs.py.func: @signatured to track state based on signature func, support poll rate, port file_property etc to this
fvwm: move cs-fvwm-blah python code into cs.app.fvwm
nodedb:
  reform map: dunders update and push changes, foreign methods to
    ingest changes, iter to watch foreign changes or all changes,
    support multiple iterators by registering notifiers?
cs.py.func: find out why eval causes syntax error with raise e from e2
vcs: modernise into "vcs top", "vcs branch", "vcs new-branch", "vcs commit" etc and track git branch changes with notes via post-commit
portfwd ARP_ADDR check for local networks
colourise command highlighing multiple regexps and line ranges
portfwd daemon mode to monitor active pf flags, start/stop relevant daemons
pf activate new-pf-clause
rename shortpath-prompt to short-path, make path breaking shortenings options (for prompt mode), make it work with relative paths and files as endpoints
setenv: remove cs.logutils, not py2.5 compatible
vbox: support remote device import for mkvdi
str: strace/ktrace wrapper, spawn ktrace + kdump -l
vbox status
vbox info
vbox: list vms is needed by some op and missing
compare curses calls between cs.logutils and cs.tty
merge cs.fileutils.shortpath and bin-cs/shortpath-prompt
myke: support +=
cs.numeric
  add histograms
  function the evaluate a rolling hash against all possible permutations
ssh-opts: cononical capitalisation of option names
cs.buffer
  unit tests
cs.fileutils:
  subfile: a file-like object proxying a byte range of another file
  tail() with blocking and nonblocking mode; follow mode? emits chunks
mp4/iso14496
  STTSBox (_GenericSampleBox): shorter rendition of .samples
cs.logutils: PfxThread to clone current prefix to new Thread, use in venti.blockify
