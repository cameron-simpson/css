  import keywords from /path/to/iphoto-library
venti:
    support ranges on GET requests
  URIs:
    x-vt:[//host[:port]]/textblockref-of-Dir/path...
  vt publish pathname
    construct and Store Dir:{basename(pathname)=>tree} and recite dirent as x-vt:/textblockref/basename/
  ftp(Dir)
    Dir can be the basis for a mount, or from a blockref etc
    CD path                     Change working path
    INSPECT name                Report metadata
    PEER other-store-name
    GET name [local-fs-name]    Export tree/file
    PUT local-fs-name [name]    Import tree/file
    BIND name textdirent        Attach existing tree/file
    PULL name   # needs peer    Fill in missing Blocks for name from peer
    PUSH name   # needs peer    Export Blocks for name to peer
    join/merge live mount points
    QUIT => sync and recite top Dirref?
  vtfuse:
    OSX Finder name of mountpoint
    do not sync unlinked files
    include/exclude rules, like rsync?
      do not sync (or Store?) excluded items
      need to promote unbacked files to backed at fs sync time based on name?
    include/exclude mount options
    support multiple mount points?
      off a single "live" antecedant Dir?
    control:
      control channel/cmd line?
      link pathname to blockspec
      merge trees
  Dir:
    rsync -a: setgid bit not preserved?
    vtftp command which accesses a Dir
      hook to vtfuse to run vtftp against live Dir
  datadir
    ticker to sync gdbm index? or just on _indexQ empty?
    report degree of gdbm batching
  ProgressStore
    proxy for a single subStore with various Progress attributes .progress_*
    convenient status line:
      {progress_add_bytes|human}:{progress_add_count} {progress_get_bytes|human} {progress_outstanding}
  S3Store
    stores Blocks directly as texthashcode.sha1
  HTTPStore
    /texthashcode.sha1
  HTTPDaemon
    /h/texthashcode.sha1 block (redirect to other http? eg an S3 backed one)
    /i/texthashcode.sha1 indirect block contents
    /d/textblockref/... Dir
      /d/textblockref/path/to/file content (internally retrieves content, presents with Content-Type)
  CloundFront ==> HTTPDaemon (possible to map /h/ directly to separate S3?)
  SyncProcess: context manager object performing some long operation
    .progress_{total|outstanding|done}
    SyncBlock(Block, local, remote): fill missing Blocks: for a Block, itself; for an IndirectBlock, also its contents
    SyncDir(Dirent): pull in contents of dir, optionally including file contents
