This is a semiautomatic message.

You seem to be the contact address for the page:
    $url
If you're not, please forward this to whoever may be.

The page <$url> is unreadable on some browsers.
This is easy to fix.
It is likely that other pages on your site are similarly affected.

echo "    $snapurl"

If you set a background colour or supply a background image for your page,
please ensure that you also set foreground colours for the text and links so
that people who don't happen to use _your_ text colour are guaranteed a
useful contrasting colour.

Remember, there are folks out there (like me) whose default environment
uses light text on a dark background. If you override only one of these
in your document, the other setting comes from the reader's default.
This mix is unpredictable, and usually bad if the reader and the
author come from differing light-on-dark and dark-on-light environments.
Thus, if you override the one you should override the other, too. A
useful colour is probably your own default colour, since you will have
checked the page's appearance using it.

This is not a fault with light background or light text, just their
combination. When a reader visits your page, if you set neither the
text colour nor the background they will get readable text since they
will have a usable set of defaults. If you set both, they should get
readable text because you will have selected a contrasting pair of
colours. HOWEVER, if you set just one (many authors set a background
and forget the foreground) there is no guarantee of contrast because
you have selected one of the colours, and the reader has selected the
other, entirely independently. As a consequence, if you set one you
incur a responsibility to set the other to maintain contrast.

Note in particular the bit on "HOW TO CONTROL THE DOCUMENT'S FOREGROUND".
The attributes you need to set in the <BODY...> tag are TEXT, LINK, VLINK,
and ALINK.
