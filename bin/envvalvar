# Save the supplied value as the named environment variable and run the specified command.
# Intended as a helper for use inside commands like "withco" that place their conntext
# as the first arg of another command. I.e. "withco module command args.." runs:
#	command path-to-module args...
# With this script one might go:
#	withco module envvalvar CONTEXTVAR command args...
# the net result is to run:
#	command args...
# with the environment variable $CONTEXTVAR set to path-to-module.
# Which is useful more often that you might think.
