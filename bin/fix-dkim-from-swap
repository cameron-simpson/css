# A different DKIM fixup from fix-dkim-from.
#
# fix-dkim-from works for lists where the original From: information
# is preserved in a quotes string in the mangled From: header.
#
# fix-dkim-from-swap is for lists where (arguably more sensibly)
# the original from header has been renamed to (by default)
# X-Original-From:. We just swap them around.
