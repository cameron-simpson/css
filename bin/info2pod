# Convert info file into POD, largely because:
#
#	- info's too stupid to read stdin, so incorporating it
#	  into other tools sucks
#
#	- I want my ordinary "man" command to find info files and
#	  do the right thing.
#         See also: http://xkcd.com/912/
#
#	- the GNU people are arrogant scum, and produce farces of
#	  manual entries, each prefaced with "we like info, so we don't
#	  maintain this page, and it's probably a pack of lies - go read the
#	  info file". Of course, the only way to do that is to fire up emacs
#	  or to use their weird info tool, which doesn't act much
#	  like a pager at all and violates the "use my preferred pager"
#	  approach people should be able to expect.
#	  
# Accordingly, since the Perl people can get this right (POD converts handily
# to all sorts of stuff), here is info2pod, which can be piped to pod2man
# to make manual entries.
