# Apply the named image file as the desktop image. This requires
# your desktop to already be set to display a static image; it seems
# "set desktop picture" just sets the magic string for the static
# desktop and fires the "refresh the desktop" activity; if that is
# set to pick from a directory etc that action will fire.
