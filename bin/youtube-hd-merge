# I spent a lot of time on a very laggy and often congested internet
# link, so streaming video is not a thing for me. Therefore I download
# video for viewing later. My youtube download plugin saves HD video
# as separate .mp4 video and .m4a audio files. This script runs in
# the save directory and joins all such pairs found together using
# ffmpeg-merge and, if successful, moves the pair into a DONE
# subdirectory for later removal.
