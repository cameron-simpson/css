Convenience facilities for objects.
-----------------------------------

Presents:
* flavour, for deciding whether an object resembles a mapping or sequence.

* O, an object subclass with a nice __str__ and convenient __init__.

* Some O_* functions for working with objects, particularly O subclasses.

* Proxy, a very simple minded object proxy intened to aid debugging.
