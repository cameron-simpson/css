  ''' Decorator for Cmd subclass methods
      to supply some basic quality of service.

      This decorator:
      - wraps the function call in a `cs.pfx.Pfx` for context
      - intercepts `getopt.GetoptError`s, issues a `warning`
        and runs `self.do_help` with the method name,
        then returns `None`
      - intercepts other `Exception`s,
        issues an `exception` log message
        and returns `None`

      The intended use is to decorate `cmd.Cmd` `do_`* methods:

          from cmd import Cmd
          class MyCmd(Cmd):
            @docmd
            def do_something(...):
              ... do something ...

    ''' Run a `Cmd` "do" method with some context and handling.

      try:
        return dofunc(self, *a, **kw)
      except GetoptError as e:
        warning("%s", e)
        self.do_help(argv0)
        return None
      except Exception as e:
        exception("%s", e)
        return None

  wrapped.__name__ = '@docmd(%s)' % (funcname,)
  wrapped.__doc__ = dofunc.__doc__
  return wrapped

class BaseCommand:
  ''' A base class for handling nestable command lines.

      This class provides the basic parse and dispatch mechanisms
      for command lines.
      To implement a command line
      one instantiates a subclass of BaseCommand:

          class MyCommand(BaseCommand):
            GETOPT_SPEC = 'ab:c'
            USAGE_FORMAT = r"""Usage: {cmd} [-a] [-b bvalue] [-c] [--] arguments...
              -a    Do it all.
              -b    But using bvalue.
              -c    The 'c' option!
            """
          ...
          the_cmd = MyCommand()

      Running a command is done by:

          the_cmd.run(argv)

      The subclass is customised by overriding the following methods:
      * `apply_defaults(options)`:
        prepare the initial state of `options`
        before any command line options are applied
      * `apply_opts(options,opts)`:
        apply the `opts` to `options`.
        `opts` is an option value mapping
        as returned by `getopot.getopt`.
      * `cmd_`*subcmd*`(argv,options)`:
        if the command line options are followed by an argument
        whose value is *subcmd*,
        then method `cmd_`*subcmd*`(argv,options)`
        will be called where `argv` contains the command line arguments
        after *subcmd*.
      * `main(argv,options)`:
        if there are no command line aguments after the options
        or the first argument does not have a corresponding
        `cmd_`*subcmd* method
        then method `main(argv,options)`
        will be called where `argv` contains the command line arguments.
      * `run_context(argv,options,cmd)`:
        a context manager to provide setup or teardown actions
        to occur before and after the command implementation respectively.
        If the implementation is a `cmd_`*subcmd* method
        then this is called with `cmd=`*subcmd*;
        if the implementation is `main`
        then this is called with `cmd=None`.

      To aid recursive use
      it is intended that all the per command state
      is contained in the `options` object
      and therefore that in typical use
      all of `apply_opts`, `cmd_`*subcmd*, `main` and `run_context`
      should be static methods making no reference to `self`.

      Editorial: why not arparse?
      Primarily because when incorrectly invoked
      an argparse command line prints the help/usage messgae
      and aborts the whole programme with `SystemExit`.

  def run(self, argv, options=None, cmd=None):
    ''' Run a command from `argv`.
        Returns the exit status of the command.
        Raises `GetoptError` for unrecognised options.

        Parameters:
        * `argv`:
          the command line arguments
          including the main command name if `cmd` is not specified.
        * `options`:
          a object for command state and context.
          If not specified a new `SimpleNamespace`
          is allocated for use as `options`,
          and prefilled with `.cmd` set to `cmd`
          and other values as set by `.apply_default(options)`
          if such a method is provided.
        * `cmd`:
          optional command name for context;
          if this is not specified it is taken from `argv.pop(0)`.

        The command line arguments are parsed according to `getopt_spec`.
        If `getopt_spec` is not empty
        then `apply_opts(opts,options)` is called
        to apply the supplied options to the state
        where `opts` is the return from `getopt.getopt(argv,getopt_spec)`.

        After the option parse,
        if the first command line argument *foo*
        has a corresponding method `cmd_`*foo*
        then that argument is removed from the start of `argv`
        and `self.cmd_`*foo*`(argv,options,cmd=`*foo*`)` is called
        and its value returned.
        Otherwise `self.main(argv,options)` is called
        and its value returned.

        If the command implementation requires some setup or teardown
        then this may be provided by the `run_context`
        context manager method,
        called with `cmd=`*subcmd* for subcommands
        and with `cmd=None` for `main`.

        is used to control the handling of `GetoptError`s raised
        during the command line parse
        or during the `main` or `cmd_`*subcmd*` calls.

        The handler is called with these parameters:
        * `cmd`: the command name
        * `options`: the `options` object
        * `e`: the `GetoptError` exception
        * `usage`: the command usage or `None` if this was not provided
        It returns a true value if the exception is considered handled,
        in which case the main `run` method returns 2.
        It returns a false value if the exception is considered unhandled,
        in which case the main `run` method reraises the `GetoptError`.

        This default handler prints an error message to standard error,
        prints the usage message (if specified) to standard error,
        and returns `True` to indicate that the error has been handled.

        To let the exceptions out unhandled
        this can be overridden with a method which just returns `False`
        or even by setting the `getopt_error_handler` attribute to `None`.

        Otherwise,
        the handler may perform any suitable action
        and return `True` to contain the exception
        or `False` to cause the exception to be reraised.
