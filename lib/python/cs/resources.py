class RunState(object):
  ''' A class to track a running task whose cancellation may be requested.

      Its purpose is twofold, to provide easily queriable state
      around tasks which can start and stop, and to provide control
      methods to pronounce that a task has started (`.start`),
      should stop (`.cancel`)
      and has stopped (`.stop`).

      A `RunState` can be used as a context manager, with the enter
      and exit methods calling `.start` and `.stop` respectively.
      Note that if the suite raises an exception
      then the exit method also calls `.cancel` before the call to `.stop`.

      Monitor or daemon processes can poll the `RunState` to see when
      they should terminate, and may also manage the overall state
      easily using a context manager.
      Example:

          def monitor(self):
              with self.runstate:
                  while not self.runstate.cancelled:
                      ... main loop body here ...

      A `RunState` has three main methods:
      * `.start()`: set `.running` and clear `.cancelled`
      * `.cancel()`: set `.cancelled`
      * `.stop()`: clear `.running`

      A `RunState` has the following properties:
      * `cancelled`: true if `.cancel` has been called.
      * `running`: true if the task is running.
        Further, assigning a true value to it also sets `.start_time` to now.
        Assigning a false value to it also sets `.stop_time` to now.
      * `start_time`: the time `.running` was last set to true.
      * `stop_time`: the time `.running` was last set to false.
      * `run_time`: `max(0,.stop_time-.start_time)`
      * `stopped`: true if the task is not running.
      * `stopping`: true if the task is running but has been cancelled.
      * `notify_start`: a set of callables called with the `RunState` instance
        to be called whenever `.running` becomes true.
      * `notify_end`: a set of callables called with the `RunState` instance
        to be called whenever `.running` becomes false.
      * `notify_cancel`: a set of callables called with the `RunState` instance
        to be called whenever `.cancel` is called.
