Yeah! Somewhere... :-(

Sure, at the OS level. Not much use for _inspection_.

If the hardlink is nearby. Of course in this example it (almost
certainly?) is, but it needn't be. A symlink is a much better solution
to this problem because:

  - usability - "ls -l" shows it to the user by default

  - practicality:

      With a symlink, to find out what it attaches to you examine the
      symlink.
      
      With a hardlink you first examine a fairly opaque numeric attribute of
      "python2", and _then_ you examine every other filename on the system!
      Admittedly starting with "python2.*" in the same directory, but in
      principle in other places. Arbitrary other places.

IMO a symlink is far and away the better choice in this situation.
