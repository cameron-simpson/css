Show the code in your next post. Otherwise people can't help you.
And cite the specific OS you're using - the st_atime behaviour has some
variation amongst the UNIX varieties. And carefully read "man 2 stat" on
whatever system you're running your code on.

And post to comp.lang.python (or better still the python-list mailing
list - they're gatewayed).
