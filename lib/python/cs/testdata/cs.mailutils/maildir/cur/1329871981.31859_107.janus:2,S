We're probably both aiming badly.

See my reply to Andrew Bennetts; I'm less concerned if his described
scenario is typical.

Yes yes yes.

| Are you suggested that they aren't currently sandboxed?

No, but it was my instinctive fear.

Please see my reply to Andrew Bennetts. I find nothing to disagree with
in your reply.
