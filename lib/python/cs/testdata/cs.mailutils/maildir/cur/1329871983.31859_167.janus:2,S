Yes. The advantages of a directory are twofold: you can't mkdir() twice
while you can usually open the same file for write more than once (hence
the umask 0777 thing, to prevent that); secondly you can put stuff in it
though that makes removing the directory more work when you're done with
it.

THE LOST WORLD is based on (so loosely as to re-define "based on" as
"with the same title as") Michael Crichton's sequel novel, which
introduced us to a second island where dinosaurs were being genetically
engineered.     - Scott Renshaw on _Jurassic_Park_'s sequel
