I think the underscore is one of the better choices:

  - it is very visible, unlike a dot or comma

  - it is "low" or "flat", not intruding into the glyph space of the
    digits, leaving things easy to read

  - it is already widely used (perl (sorry), Ada (where I first
    encountered it now that someone ele has mentioned it, etc)
    i.e. it is a pre-existing idom with successful use

I'm very -1 on this one. Like another recent proposal it take a common
typing error and turns it into legal syntax. Code that once would fail
to compile because the author dropped a comma between values now runs,
with silent breakage (the new stuff isn't even the wrong type!)

It's there as a sop to former Ada programmers.  :-)
