Steven is also talking about tutorials. Perhaps my comprehension skiils
are weak; I am basing my assrtion on his use of the word "tutorials" in
the sentence:

  Removing 2.x tutorials would be cutting off our nose to spite our
  face.

I admit my reading here may be superficial and that you may be seeing a
deeper intent.

I confess to finding these two sentences in your message contradictory.
Again, my poor comprehension skills must be to blame.
