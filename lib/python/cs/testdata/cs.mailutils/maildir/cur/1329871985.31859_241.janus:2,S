It looks a lot like javadoc. But its weakness is stuff like this:

  http://epydoc.sourceforge.net/stdlib/Canvas.Polygon-class.html

Automatic docness, no useful information.

And of course the ugliness; I find the python docs much nicer to look
at. But I do wish the cross referencing was a bit better, often.
