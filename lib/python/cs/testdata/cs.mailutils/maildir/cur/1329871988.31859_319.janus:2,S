[ This particular reply is off-list - it is just about the "|" indent marker;

They're automatically generated by my mail program,
I find them a bit easier on the eye than the conventional "> " indent
marker.

I'm using mutt for email (www.mutt.org) and have this line in my config
file:

  set indent_string="| "

which arranges to use "| " instead of the default "> ".
