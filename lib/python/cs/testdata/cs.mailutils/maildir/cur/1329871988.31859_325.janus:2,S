Your example did:

    from urllib.request import urlopen
    response = urlopen('http://python.org/') html =
    response.read()

That's not what he meant.

Your file is called "http.py".
Python searches the current directory first.
That means that when any library module (internally) tried to use
the "http" module it will find your file, not the library module.

So you don't get to use the http library module.

Rename your http.py file to "my-http-test.py" and retry.
Then its name won't get in the way of the library name.
