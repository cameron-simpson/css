Hmm. I'm in the "terminals are my IDE" camp. I never felt any need to
use an IDE when I was using Java. Indeed, the highly linked and cross
referenced nature of javadoc output made the docs so helpful that I
doubt I would ever want in-editor completion/prompting.

So "essential"? No. For people comfortable in IDEs, they're probably
very helpful.

And there's the rub. IDEs tend to force the programmer into their tools,
rather than letting the programmer choose the tools. The xterms+vim
approach is really "your desktop is the IDE". The programmer can use
their preferred editor, their preferred terminal or interactive code
interpreter, their preferred document viewer, their preferred build tool
(vi[m], rxvt-unicode, web browser, myke respectively for me). If the IDE
doesn't integrate _your_ preferred tools, the IDE isn't helping you.

I'm not a fan of code completion; I find it annoying and cumbersome. But
that is just me. My fingers speak vi (indeed, I'm writing this email in
vi as well) and don't want to learn a suite of extras. I'm sure an adept
user of an IDE can produce syntactically correct and correctly spelt
code text faster than I, but I don't think that's where the majority of
my screen time goes.

Good docs (clean well indexed HTML, like javadoc and the python docs)
and a good HTML reader for me, rather than code completion.

Cheers,
