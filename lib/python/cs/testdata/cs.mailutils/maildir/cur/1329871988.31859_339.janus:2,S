Renaming a file in no way changes its content. So of course you get the
same result.

You also write:

It might help if you said _what_ text editor you used. Some GUI text
editors like TextEdit on a Mac can understand word processor files.
"Plain" text editors will show you binary stuff like your python program
did.

| unable to do the same thru a word document...

I have no idea what this sentence means, however.
