NUL cannot occur in a POSIX file path, if for no other reason than that
the API uses C strings, which are NUL terminated.

So, yes, you could use NUL as an escape character if you're sure you're
never dealing with _non_POSIX pathnames:-)

*REAL* climbers are crude, impolite, solitary, abrupt, arrogant.  Sport
climbers are cool.
