| It would be nice if Python offered a straightforward equivalent to
| 
|     ... initialization goes here ...
|     do /*once*/
|       {
|         ... do stuff ...
|         if (check1_failed)
|             break;
|         ... do more stuff ...
|         if (check2_failed)
|             break;
|         ... do even more stuff ...
|       }
|     while (false);
|     ... cleanup goes here ...

  while True:
    ... do stuff ...
    if check1_failed:
      break;
    ... do more stuff ...
    if check2_failed:
      break;
    ... do even more stuff ...
    break
  ... cleanup goes here ...

Seems more straightforward to me!

And there's always try/except and context managers.

So why can't we celebrate November 5th the way Guy Fawkes would've wanted?
