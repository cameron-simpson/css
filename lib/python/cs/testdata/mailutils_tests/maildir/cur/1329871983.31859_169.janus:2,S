os.unlink removes the filename. On all sane systems, if that is the last
reference to the file (no other names, no open file handles) then the
memory/storage is also released.

Don't be.

I confess to disliking Windows, but I do not believe it is that broken.

Last month, my alumni/ae association sent out a questionnaire. One of the
questions they asked was my/my household's annual income. The choices were:
(a) Less than $25,000, (b) $25,001-50,000, (c) $50,001-100,000,
(d) $100,001-250,000, (e) $250,001-500,000, (f) $500,001-1,000,000,
(g) $1,000,000 or more. Yeah, right. Nice median.
