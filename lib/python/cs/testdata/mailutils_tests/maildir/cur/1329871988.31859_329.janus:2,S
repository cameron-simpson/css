| This is just a guess, but looks like your h function is a plain
| function, not a method, so it doesn't take a "self" parameter. Also,

And have a look at the documentation for the "functools" module,
particularly the "partial" function:

  f2 = functools.partial(f, arg1, arg2, ...)

Then calling f2() will call f(arg1, arg2, ...). So you can pass "f2"
to an event handler. Of course, this means you need to know arg1 etc in
advance.

However, you really do need to show the calling end of your code.

You see: Mr. Drogo, he married poor Miss Primula Brandybuck.  She was our Mr.
Bilbo's first cousin on the mother's side (her mother being the youngest of
the Old Took's daughters); and Mr. Drogo was his second cousin.  So Mr. Frodo
is his first *and* second cousin, once removed either way, as the saying is,
if you follow me.       - the Gaffer, _Lord_of_the_Rings_
