This might be a terminology problem. I think, above, Brian means "good
enough" to mean "looks ok at first cut but doesn't handle the corner
cases". Which usually means obscure breakage later.

I almost am Brian's hypothetical user. I've got a "FuncMultiQueue" that
accepts callables in synchronous and asynchronous modes for future
possibly-concurrent execution, just as the futures module does. I've
spent a _lot_ of time debugging it.

There's a lot to be said for a robust implementation of a well defined
problem. Brian's module, had it been present and presuming it robust and
debugged, would have been quite welcome.

Cheers,
