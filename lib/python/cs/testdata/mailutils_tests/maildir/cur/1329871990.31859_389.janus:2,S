And not before time, either :-(

But unless they require it to be usable as unit tests (eg running as
validation of a live transaction stream, or in some audit mode) it may be
less useful than one might hope. Of course, if they're gone as far as
requiring python code, perhaps that's exactly what they hope to be able to
do.
