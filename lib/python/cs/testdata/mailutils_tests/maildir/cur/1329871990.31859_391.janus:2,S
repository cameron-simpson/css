How well does a stream of XPM files compress? Probably not enough, I
would guess. Just wondering.

Do you need to move a "standard" image format around? If everything's
16x16 8 bit colour (and if, with luck, they share a colour map) maybe
you can ship raw bytes expressing what you want.

How colourful are these GIFs?
