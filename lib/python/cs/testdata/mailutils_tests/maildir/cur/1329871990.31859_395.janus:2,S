Having quickly read the Abstract and Motivation, why is this any better
than a pair of threads and a pair of Queue objects? (Aside from
co-routines being more lightweight in terms of machine resources?)

On the flipside, given that generators were recently augumented to
support coroutines I can see your motivation within that framework.

C makes it easy for you to shoot yourself in the foot.  C++ makes that
harder, but when you do, it blows away your whole leg.
