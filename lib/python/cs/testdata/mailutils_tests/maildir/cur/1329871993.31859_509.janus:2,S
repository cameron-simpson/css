But you should probably _not_ have thunderbird open when you modify them; it
expects exclusive access. Also, if you modify a file you should probably
remove the corresponding .sdb file, which is a cache of Thunderbird's
knowledge of the mbox contents (header values and probably message offsets
within the file).
