# Extract all components of an email message with munpack into the specified
# directory.
# Extraction actually happens in a new subdirectory of the target.
# After extraction, _within_ that subdirectory:
#   If a command is supplied, run that after extraction.
#   If no command is supplied and if the shell script autoexec.sh is present in
#   the directory, run that after extraction.
#   Otherwise use "mrg" to merge the files into the target directory.
