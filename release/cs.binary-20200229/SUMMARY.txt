ListField: replace transcribe method with transcribe_value method, aids external use.
Add `.length` attribute to struct based packet classes providing the data length of the structure (struct.Struct.size).
Packet: new `add_deferred_field` method to consume the raw data for a field for parsing later (done automatically if the attribute is accessed).
New `@deferred_field` decorator for the parser for that stashed data.
