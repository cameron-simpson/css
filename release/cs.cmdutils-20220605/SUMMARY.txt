BaseCommand: new popopts(argv,...) compact getopt wrapper.
BaseCommand: new poparg(argv,...) compact validating argument consumer.
BaseCommand: drop run_argv, provided no utility.
BaseCommand.run: get the RunState signal list from self.options.runstate_signals.
BaseCommand.apply_opts: support multiple individual options raising GetoptError, as I hate commands which abort at the first bad option.
Assorted other small things.
