BaseCommand: make SUBCOMMAND_ARGV_DEFAULT be 'shell' for an interactive prompt, still a little unsure how sensible this is, aiming at the very cool submode stuff from the Cisco switch config command line.
BaseCommandOptions: new as_dict() method.
New SubCommand.usage_text() to compose the full usage text for this SubCommand.
Many small improvements and internal refactors.
