BaseCommand.cmd_help: new -l (long), -r (recurse) and -s (short, not long) options.
A big rework of the help/usage output; still one rough edge left.
BaseCommandOptions.popopts: infill with False instead of None for missing boolean options.
SubCommand: a few new methods and properties to expose various operations.
BaseCommand._prerun_setup: revert SUBCOMMAND_ARGV_DEFAULT to None, make a missing subcommand run "help -s" when there's no SUBCOMMAND_ARGV_DEFAULT.
