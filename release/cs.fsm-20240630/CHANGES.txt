lib/python/cs/fsm.py: cs.fsm,result: move CancellationError from cs.result to cs.fsm, and use it to catch silently FSM event callbacks which raise it
lib/python/cs/fsm.py: merge default ==> vt
lib/python/cs/fsm.py: cs.fsm: CancellationError: subclass FSM
lib/python/cs/fsm.py: cs.fsm: FSM.fsm_event: run callbacks in a separate worker Thread to avoid deadlocks (in cs.result.Result)
lib/python/cs/fsm.py: cs.fsm: fix Thread name typo, add a few type annotations
lib/python/cs/fsm.py: cs.fsm: FSM.fsm_event,fsm_callback: further notes about how the callbacks work
lib/python/cs/fsm.py: cs.fsm: FSM.fsm_event: return the the former behaviour of running the callbacks synchronously before return, far less surprising
