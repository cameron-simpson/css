ILST: recognise @cpy as copyright, sfID as itunes_store_country_code.
ILST: new SFID_ISO_3166_1_ALPHA_3_CODE and STIK_MEDIA_TYPES providing context data for various field values, as yet unused.

add_generic_sample_boxbody: drop __iter__, causes dumb iterators to parse the samples.
ILST: iTunes "Date" metadata seem to contain plain years or ISO8601 datestamps.
mp4 autotag: add -n (no action) and -p,--prefix (set tag prefix, default 'mp4') options.
mp4 autotag: use "mp4." as the tag prefix.
