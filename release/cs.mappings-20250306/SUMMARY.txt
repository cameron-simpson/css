Mark MappingChain as obsolete.
New missingdict(factory:Callable[key]) type, like defaultdict but capable of key specific default values.
New @mapped_property decorator to turn a key-based factory method into a mapping of key->value.
Now requires Python >= 3.6 (for format strings, already in use previously).
