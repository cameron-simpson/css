AsyncPipeLine.__call__: just return self.outq, use try/finally in submit.
@agen: new optional `fast` parameter, plumbed to async_iter().
amap: progressive async consume and dispatch, allowing yield of results as items come in - no longer waits for all items to be dispatched before yielding results.
amap: new fast=False parameter to indicate that func does not block.
Some small fixes.
