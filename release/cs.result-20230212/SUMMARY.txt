Result._complete: release self._get_lock before firing the event, as the event is what fires the notifiers.
Result.notify: when we make a direct notifier call, call the notifier outside the lock and remember to set self.collected=True.
Result: new post_notify() method to queue a function of the Result.result, returning a Result for the completion of the post function.
