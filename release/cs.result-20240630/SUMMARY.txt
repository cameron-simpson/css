Move CancellationError from cs.result to cs.fsm.
report: avoid iterating over the live set.
Result: drop the PREPARE state, allow 'cancel' no-op event in CANCELLED and DONE states.
Result.result,exc_info getters: raise CancellationError if the Result is cancelled.
Result._complete: fire the 'complete' event after the ._result and ._exc_info attributes are set but still before the self._get_lock.release().
Result: preserve message passed to .cancel(), _complete raises RuntimeError if already complete.
