New ValueDetail and KeyValueDetail classes for returning ontology information; TagInfo.detail now returns a ValueDetail for scalar types, a list of ValueDetails for sequence types and a list of KeyValueDetails for mapping types; drop various TagInfo mapping/iterable style methods, too confusing to use.
Plumb ontology parameter throughout, always optional.
Drop TypedTag, Tags now use ontologies for this.
New TagsCommandMixin to support BaseCommands which manipulate Tags.
Many improvements and bugfixes.
