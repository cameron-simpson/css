Upd.run_task: use a local RunState to control the ticker, drop `runstate` parameter.
Renamed default HasThreadState.THREAD_STATE_ATTR to 'perthread_state'.
Keep a module level name for the default Upd instance.
Upd.shutdown: cope with shutdown early enough that there's no self._lock.
Honour new $CS_UPD_BACKEND envvar to support eg defaulting Upd to /dev/null.
