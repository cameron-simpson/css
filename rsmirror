# =head1 NAME
#
# rsmirror - maintain a local mirror of portions of rsync/http/ftp servers
#
# =head1 SYNOPSIS
#
# B<rsmirror> [B<-d> I<dir>] [B<-f> I<config>] [B<-n>] [B<-P>] [B<-v>] [B<-t> I<secs>] [[I<server>]B<::>I<root>...]
#
# =head1 DESCRIPTION
#
# I<rsmirror> reads a configuration file
# to obtain a list of rsync servers and repository information
# and keeps a local mirror up to date.
# It will also handle B<http:> and B<ftp:> servers
# although rsync(1) is much to be preferred if available.

# =head1 CONFIGURATION FILE FORMAT
#
# The configuration file
# is normally named B<.mirror>
# and contains lines describing repositories to mirror.
# Blank lines and lines commencing with an octothorpe (B<#>)
# are discarded.
#
# A line of the form:
#
#	umask octal-value
#
# sets the umask for the script as specified (see umask(1)).
# A typical umask for a public mirror with a group of people
# who may maintain it would be 2.
#
# Other lines are of the form:
#
#	[I<method>] I<server> I<root> [I<localroot>] [I<options>...]
#
# If omitted, I<method> defaults to B<rsync>
# (and in consequence I<server> should be a FQDN so that it does not resemble a I<method> name).
# The other methods known are B<http> and B<ftp>, for which the wget(1) command is used
# in mirror mode.
#
# The I<server> is an IP address or hostname
# as may be passed to the rsync(1) command.
#
# The I<root> is the subtree of the I<server>'s mirror
# that is to be copied.
#
# The optional I<localroot>
# specifies where to place the subtree at this end.
# If omitted, the value of I<root> is used.
# I<localroot> may not commence with a dash(B<->)
# (in order to distinguish it from I<options>).
# If I<localroot> does not commence with a slash (B</>)
# it is taken relative to I<dir>.
#
# Options specific to this particular line
# may then follow, typically I<rsync>'s B<--include=> and B<--exclude=>
# options
# or wgte(1)'s B<--accept> and B<--reject> options.
#
# For the B<rsync> method, the special option B<--latest>
# may be specified as the first of these options;
# it causes the mirror to only include the latest version
# of versioned files
# (eg "B<foo-1.2.tar.gz>")
# from mirrors such as the GNU one
# which keep multiple instances of software releases,
# which eases your local disc space burden.
# See the latest(1) script.

    # =head2 Per Mirror Configuration
    #
    # There is an additional facility for overly complex I<options>.
    # For each line a check is made for a file named:
    #
    #	I<config>-I<method>-I<server>-I<root-trans>
    #
    # where I<config> is the name of the main configuration file
    # and I<root-trans> is the I<root> string with slashes (B</>)
    # replaced by colons (B<:>).
    #
    # For the I<method> B<rsync>
    # the presence of this file causes the option:
    #
    #	B<--include-from=>I<config>-I<method>-I<server>-I<root-trans>
    #
    # to be prepended to the options passed to rsync, and so it should be an
    # rsync(1) include/exclude file.
    # This is a I<much> more succinct and readable way to pass complicated
    # include/exclude patterns to I<rsync>.
    #
    # Also, the presence of the file:
    #
    #	I<config>-I<method>
    #
    # is sought for all lines, and used if present.
    # This is for global specifications.

# =head1 EXAMPLES AND TIPS
#
# A nightly mirror run might read:
#
# 	rsmirror -v -t 1200
#
# This produces a log of the update in my email
# and prevents a huge update or a misconfiguration at my end
# from using my link forever.
#
# You can find out what is available like this:
#
#	rsync mirror.aarnet.edu.au::
#
# (That's a command, not a line from the B<.mirror> file).
# You can then check out what's inside by putting a simple
# line in your B<.mirror> file:
#
#	rsync mirror.aarnet.edu.au redhat
#
# and saying:
#
#	rsmirror -v -n mirror.aarnet.edu.au::redhat
#
# which runs a verbose no-action run of just that line.
# Examine the output and start tuning your include/exclude list.
# For anything complex you'll probably want to make a per-mirror
# config file, which for the above example would be named:
#
#	.mirror-rsync-mirror.aarnet.edu.au-redhat
#
# See the B<--include-from=> option from the rsync(1) manual entry
# for details on the format.
#
# There is also an optional config file:
#
#	.mirror-rsync
#
# which will be used before the per-mirror file.
# Ours just says:
#
#	- .nfs[0-9]*
#
# which ignores NFS tempoprary files.
#
# =head1 CAUTION
#
# It is I<very> easy to request ludicrous quantities of data with this program.
# Always make trial runs with the B<-n> and B<-v> flags
# before using in any noninteractive context.
# Also, think carefully about what you mirror.
# It is easy to waste more bandwidth by mirroring
# unnecessary stuff instead of only what you will really benefit from.
# Finally,
# try to mirror from a nearby host
# such as your local country or ISP mirror service
# if possible.
#
# =head1 CAVEATS
#
# As you may imagine,
# the rsync protocol does not use your web proxy.
# If you're mirroring popular stuff you may wish to do the initial
# fetch of a lot of the big stuff with an HTTP-based tool like
# I<wget> or I<curl> or I<lynx>.
# That way the data are in your web cache
# in case someone does a fetch before your mirror is up to speed.
#
# Remember, mirrors are a waste of resources if not used.
# Make sure your site's population is well aware of your mirror
# and encouraged to consult first it and then your nearest archive site
# before hammering the origin server of any significant data
# they want.
#
# The rsync(1) invocation used in rsmirror
# does not preserve permissions or owners or groups
# (because they are meaningless for public data like this).
# I run our nightly mirror with a umask(1) of B<002>
# and arrange group access to allow our sysadmin team
# to manipulate the mirror.
