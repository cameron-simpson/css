# =head1 NAME
#
# runmaint - run a maintenance script
#
# =head1 SYNOPSIS
#
# runmaint [B<-s> I<subj>] [B<-date> I<datestr>] [B<-x>] I<target> [I<addresses...>]
#
# =head1 DESCRIPTION
#
# B<runmaint> is a wrapper for cron(8) jobs which
# lets the user keep their crontab static and simple,
# moves all the shell complexity into scripts,
# supplies a standard, configurable, environment to the scripts,
# cascades regular scripts through a simple naming scheme
# and delivers the output of scripts as email with a useful subject line.
# Optionally, it will deliver to a log file
# or standard output and standard error.
#
# See:
#
#	http://www.cskk.ezoshosting.com/cs/runmaint.html
#
# for more detailed info.
#
# =head1 INSTALLATION
#
# Normally I<runmaint> is installed as part of the B<css> package in </opt/css>,
# and the examples below are written on that basis.
#
# =head1 PERSONAL SETUP
#
# Create a directory B<.maint> in your home directory.
# Scripts run from cron(8) go here.
#
# Create a crontab file with the crontab(1) command.
# Typically this is a single line such as:
#
#	0 * * * * exec /opt/css/bin/runmaint hourly
#
# or
#
#	0 0 * * * exec /opt/css/bin/runmaint daily
#
# The word after the B<runmaint> command is the name of a script to run
# from the B<~/.maint> directory.
#
# The words B<hourly>, B<daily>, B<weekly>, B<monthly> and B<yearly>
# are special.
# If a script with this name is run and happens to fall on the
# due time for the less frequent script
# then that script is also run on completion of the more frequent script.
# In this way the hourly cron line above also causes the B<daily>, B<weekly>,
# B<monthly> and B<yearly> scripts to be run as appropriate.
# Further, unlike multiple cron lines of different frequency,
# the timing is guarrenteed not to overlap nor is there undue delay
# between the termination of the more frequent script
# and commencement of the subsequent less frequent script.
#
# Also, whenever any script B<foo> is requested
# B<runmaint> also looks for scripts named B<foo.I<host>>
# and B<foo.I<host>@I<systemid>>
# and runs them if they are present.
# I<host> and I<systemid> take their names from the environment variables
# B<$HOST> and B<$SYSTEMID> respectively.
# I normally arrange these to be the short hostname (i.e. without the domain)
# and an identifier-like name for the local administrative domain
# (eg B<home> for my home machines).
# With this mechanism
# you can place the cron line on many machines
# and still perform specific actions on particular machines
# simply by adding suitably named scripts.
# If B<$HOST> or B<$SYSTEMID> are missing,
# B<runmaint> infers B<$HOST> from the first component of the output of the hostname(1) command,
# and sets B<$SYSTEMID> to B<localdomain>.
#
# Additionally,
# if B<foo> names a directory
# then all files in the top level of that directory are run.
#
# =head1 ENVIRONMENT
#
# B<Runmaint> prepopulates the environment
# with some convenience variables
# reflecting the date and time
# that B<runmaint> commenced.
# These are derived from the output of date(1), and are:
#
#  wday The day of the week, eg "Tue".
#  mon  The month, eg "Apr".
#  mday The month day, eg 23.
#  hh   The hour, eg 09.
#  mm   The minute, eg 13.
#  ss   The seconds, eg 00.
#  tz   The timezone.
#  year The year, eg 1998.
#
# These are passed to any cascaded scripts intact
# i.e. if a 6pm runmaint job kicks off and runs long enough
# that some cascased jobs commences much later
# the convenience variables will still be for 6pm.
#
# Before running any script
# B<runmaint> sources the file
# B</opt/css/etc/runmaint/env>.
# Systemwide default environment settings go in here as shell commands.
# After this the file
# B<~/.maint/env> is sourced.
# Personal environment settings go in here as shell commands.
#
# Usually you will want the cron environment to resemble the login
# environment closely
# and so B</opt/css/etc/runmaint/env> would normally contain the line
#
#	. /etc/profile
#
# and the B<~/.maint/env> file would reasonably contain the line
#
#	. $HOME/.profile
#
# in this way sourcing the user's normal startup files.
#
# =head2 RUNMAINT_DIR
#
# The installation prefix, typically C</opt/css> or C</usr/local>.
# The default comes from B<$OPTCSS> (default: B</opt/css>)
# fitting the syncopt scheme as described here:
#
#	http://www.cskk.ezoshosting.com/cs/syncopt/

# as they are used unquoted, and are thus subject to whitespace separation etc.

# rather than being redirected to email,
# sometimes useful for running from the command line or for special purposes.

# If no I<addresses> are present
# then the default is to email the user
# as defined by the B<$EMAIL> environment variable
# or failing that the B<$USER> environment variable.
# However,
# if the directory B<~/.maint/log> is present
# then the absense of I<addresses> causes output to be delivered
# to the log file B<~/.maint/log/I<target>@I<host>>.
# Further, if that is a directory then output is delivered to the log file
# B<~/.maint/log/I<target>@I<host>/I<datecode>>
