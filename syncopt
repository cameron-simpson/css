#
# syncopt - keep per-machine /opt in sync with master copy
#
# =head1 SYNOPSIS
#
# syncopt [options] [packages...]
#
# =head1 DESCRIPTION
#
# I<syncopt> is a command for keeping host local package installations
# synchronised with a master host.
# More detailed discussion of its use and the practices associated with
# it is at this web page:
#
#	http://www.cskk.ezoshosting.com/cs/syncopt/index.html
#
# The intent is that packages built from source
# (and to a limited extent other packages with relocatable installs)
# need only be installed once on a central host,
# and that ``client'' machines get a local copy or a symbolic link
# as the administrator sees fit.
#
# The basic scheme is that packages get built and installed as B</opt/I<package>-I<version>>
# and then copied to a central spot such as B</u/syncopt/I<arch>/I<package>-I<version>>,
# leaving a symlink from B</opt> to the central package.
# In this way things think they
# live in B</opt> and become local or remote by either symlinking from B</opt> to the central copy
# or by installing an exact copy of B</u/syncopt/I<arch>/I<thing>-I<version>> in </opt>.
#
# The purpose of B<syncopt> is to maintain that arrangement in a convenient and automatic fashion.
#
# It would normally be run automatically on client machines via cron,
# or batch dispatched on all clients by hand via ssh after a new package install.

# For example, at home I set this to "B<HOME WORK>".
# I put home built software in B</u/syncopt/$ARCH/HOME/I<package>>
# and keep a copy of much of the repository from work in B</u/syncopt/$ARCH/WORK/I<package>>,
# obviating any need to rebuild things already built for work.
# The subhierachies are consulted in order,
# thus arranging that my home installs
# take precedence over the work copies.
#
# =item B<SYNCOPT_RSYNC>
#
# Preferred path to the rsync(1) command
# as though specified with the B<-R> command line option.
# The default is "B<rsync>".
#
# =item B<SYNCOPT_RSYNCOPTS>
#
# Extra command line options to supply to rsync(1).
# This was implemented primarily to allow supply of the B<--copy-links>
# option to make link safe local copies,
# robust against loss of a central server which my ordinarily have been supplying
# some non-local packages.
#
# =item B<RSYNC_RSH>
#
# Ssh command to use, as for rsync, if a remote host is in use.
# The default is "B<ssh>".
#
# =back
#
# =head1 EXAMPLE CONFIGURATION FILES
#
# A typical machine with a small B</opt> area might say:
#
#	perl local
#	mozilla local
#	fvwm local
#
# and so forth to make particular packages normally used by the machine's owner
# locally installed
# to provide resilience against downtime on the master NFS server.
#
# A modern machine with plenty of room might say:
#
#	* local
#
# so that all packages are installed locally,
# providing complete NFS independence from the master host.
#
# A minimal service machine
# which normally has no NFS mounts at all
# but which wants some packages installed might say:
#
#	* nosync
#	perl local
#	rsync local
#	script local
#
# to make local installs of useful packages only,
# and no installs at all of the rest.
# This machine must be maintained by passing the B<-r> option to B<syncopt>
# to use ssh(1) to access the master machine
# or by setting the B<SYNCOPT_REMOTE> environment variable
# in the system environment.
#
# The same style of configuration would be used for a mobile machine
# such as a laptop
# which would not have everything local
# but also would frequently not have NFS access either,
# and which would not want to try
# (eg if the NFS were automounted - you don't want stray symlinks firing
# it up off site).
