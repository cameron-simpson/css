#
# unhashpod - extract the pod content from a script
#
# =head1 SYNOPSIS
#
# unhashpod [files...]
#
# =head1 DESCRIPTION
#
# Extract commented perlpod(1) markup from scripts
# for presentation to pod2man(1) et al.
# For most UNIX scripts the pod must be hidden in comments,
# so I've adopted the style of a leading # on pod markup.
#
# Formally, lines from one matching the regexp:
#
#	^[ \t]*# *=[a-z]
#
# through to the next noncomment line or a B<=cut> line
# are emitted to stdout in pod form.
#
# =head1 SEE ALSO
